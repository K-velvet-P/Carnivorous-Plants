  Facts about plants

      <li>   Most of the 600 species of carnivorous plants can be divided into five types: pitcher plants, sundews, butterworts, bladderworts, and Venus flytraps.</li><br>
    
      <li> Carnivorous plants grow in wetlands where nutrients are scarce, so they turn to living creatures for their food.</li><br>
      <li> After a tiny insect touches a bladderwort’s trigger hairs and is sucked in to be devoured, it takes the plant only 30 minutes or less to reset its trap. </li><br>
      <li> 
    Carnivorous plants usually throw their flowers high into the air so that the insects who do the pollinating don’t get stuck in the plants’ traps before they can get the job done.</li><br>

    <li> 
    Sundews get their name from glistening, sticky, hairlike trichomes, which secrete enzymes that digest insects unlucky enough to get stuck. </li><br>

    <li> 
    The adaptation of trapping and digesting prey has arisen at least nine times in different plant families in response to soil lacking the nutrients nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium.</li><br>

    <li> 
    The 600 or so carnivorous species on the planet today thrive in places where other plants struggle, including bogs and heaths. </li><br>

 <li> 
    Traps are specialized leaves and vary widely among species, from a pitcher plant’s cup-shaped trap to the snapping taco shell of a Venus’ flytrap. </li><br>

<li> 
    The Venus’ flytrap may be the most famous plant carnivore, but Utricularia, or bladderworts, are the most widespread, found on every continent except Antarctica. </li><br>

    <li> 
    Fairly common Geranium viscosissimum is considered protocarnivorous: Its enzymes can digest protein, but it lacks a trap. </li><br>
